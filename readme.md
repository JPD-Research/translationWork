18-Dec - pulled everything together into this set of notebooks
- config conda
  - setup git repo in JPD-Research organization  
  - ensure env is setup to store EVERYTHING locally 
    - base xfrmr_tf "transformer with tensorflow" environment 
      - python 3.11 (most recent current for tf)
      - install jupyter, tensorflow 
- config pycharm
  - pointed to the env setup above 
  - setup this file
  - baseline notebook for first project
- test drive the notebook env - hello world
  - first checkin into the repo <**> (<- this is a checkin marker)
- reconfigure to start the RNN work
  - had the recurring issue where the notebook doesn't use the interpreter from the configured python environment
  - "conda install nb_conda_kernels" as per [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39604271/conda-environments-not-showing-up-in-jupyter-notebook)
  - reconfigured the python interpreter properly in PyCharm as well - required pip install -U charset to remove a chardet module error
  - actually pulled the conda and python environments off of a spinning drive, onto M2 - much faster
- Actual RNN work
  - load and validate the data
  - add utilities to vectorize and sequence the data
  - turn data sequences into training batches for the model
  - <**> checkin - data loaded - prior to model construction 
  - <**> checkin - built the model and started to train
