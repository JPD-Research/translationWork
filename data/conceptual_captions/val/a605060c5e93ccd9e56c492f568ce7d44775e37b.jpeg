            "description": "We stumbled upon Garden Affairs by accident whilst visiting Trowbridge Garden Centre last year.   From this first visit we liked the look of the buildings on display and it was decided that a garden office from here would suit our needs perfectly.\n\nAs the structure would be sited at the front of our house, it made it a bit more complicated as it doesn\u2019t fall under permitted development rights.  We had an initial consultation with Richard who was very experienced and knowledgeable about the intricacies of planning law.  He helped navigate us through the options open to us and recommended a consultant to assist with the approval process.\n\nWe found the whole team to be friendly and helpful throughout both the design and build stages.   Now construction is complete we are very pleased with the look and quality of the finished building.  A very minor snagging issue we noticed shortly after completion was rectified the same day we reported it so we are confident that the after-sales service is solid going forward.\n\nOnce we have added some finishing touches and furniture to the area in front of the office it will have opened up a fantastic new space that was previously unused.   We have found Garden Affairs to have exceeded our expectations every step of the way and therefore wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend them to anyone else looking to buy.",

            "description": "I spent quite a lot of time researching options for a garden office before finding Garden Affairs, their solutions fitted my requirements perfectly and opted for the midi office. There are similar suppliers a bit more local, but I opted for Garden Affairs specifically because they weren't just builders, but delivered impeccable customer service and experience.\n\nThey guide you through the journey and advised what the best options were, this was critical for my project as their deep knowledge of how to approach specifics helped me to take the right decisions. They clearly explained potential challenges such as delivery and how to mitigate them. Their website and the team provide plenty of useful information on how to plan, maintain, approach electrics, planning permission and so on which was useful.\n\nThey built the office exactly to specification and was exactly how I envisioned it. The team are friendly, responsive and helpful and would recommend them to anyone interested in a customised garden office.",

            "description": "I had been looking for about six months for a garden room. I should explain that I live in a very old terraced cottage with small doors so the room I required had to be flat packed.\n\nI was looking for a room 3m x 2.6m. A lot of firms would build me one bespoke but would charge well over \u00a310,000. My budget was about \u00a35,000.\n\nI found Garden Affairs website and they had plenty of examples of rooms in my size and price bracket. I decided to drive two and a half hours to their premises in Trowbridge from Brighton to see the rooms for myself.\n\nIt was well worth the journey. I spoke with Richard and he was very helpful and not at all pushy. The build of these rooms was exceptional. The floor and roof boards were thicker than my previous shed walls. The walls of the new garden rooms were all 44mm.\n\nRichard designed my garden room for me with me telling him where I wanted the door and the window. Once the design was finished the price came to the same as quoted on the internet.\n\nI was told that the delivery time would be approximately 18 weeks. However it turned up in 14 weeks.\n\nTwo of us, both in our 50s, took two days to build the room. The first 4 hours we didn't need a screwdriver or hammer it really is just like building Lego. (You will need a rubber mallet) I would just say that if you do have a double door in your room that it is VERY heavy. It is a very good double glazed door so this is to be expected.\n\nI spoke to Garden affairs and threatened them with lots of questions during the building but it turned out to be straightforward.\n\nI really cant recommend Garden Affairs enough and I would also like to thank Doug who was very helpful.\n\nIn the added photos you will see that I built the room on a decking. The decking is very sturdy and could probably take a brick house on it. Make sure you do put a sturdy and level base down. Garden Affairs have some great mishaps on their website of improper bases.\n\nIn one of the pictures you can see a bench seat with blue cushions on. I made that from the spare wood that came with the room. From what I gather they supply at least one extra piece of wood of all the lengths just in case you have a problem with any of them.\n\nThe picture on the street is how it turns up. The bottom package is all the wood, the middle is the door and window and the top bit is the insulation.\n\nI hope I have got across in this review how impressed I am not only with the garden room itself but also Garden Affairs.",

            "description": "We have been delighted with all aspects of the interaction with Garden Affairs and would recommend them most highly. We removed an older prefabricated garage to accommodate the summer house in the back garden on an existing flat concrete slab. Consequently, we approached Garden Affairs for a bespoke design, based on a model that we had seen on the company website, with minor modifications to fit the base. We exchanged many e-mails and telephone calls to identify what could be achieved before visiting the site to examine the quality of the products. The demonstration buildings were very impressive and these convinced us to purchase the summer house. Working on a budget (and keen for a lockdown project) I opted to go for a self-build option, with initial help from a friend to construct the shell to roof level. The delivery from a flatbed with crane arm was very efficient, despite our rural location on a narrow lane, and the build list was comprehensive. The plans were very clear and help was available at the end of the telephone or via e-mail (this was greatly appreciated as this was the first project that I had attempted of this magnitude). The after-market service has been second to none when minor issues (around lock fit/door adjustment) have arisen and these have been solved quickly and efficiently by return post or with a further call. The summer house is now complete, aside from a second coat of exterior paint (when the weather improves and the temperature rises) and we're delighted with the result.",

The construction team was brilliant - focussed and efficient - and so were the second fix electrical contractors. We were particularly pleased at being able to customise the length and breadth so finely to fit the finished structure into a tight space. Despite Covid-19, the lead-time between ordering and completion was as originally advised. The result is a magnificent room, fitting exquisitely into an existing space and harmonising beautifully with its surroundings. We'd unreservedly recommend the whole outfit.",

We are particularly pleased with the Sedum roof and the configuration of the building. Dealing with the team at Garden Affairs  has been a pleasure and the building delivered is high quality and will last for decades to come.

For starters, the help from the sales team was very clear and instructive - they've all built these things themselves so know every detail. When it arrived, as a big pile of wood on my drive,  I have to admit to worrying that I'd bitten off more than I could chew. However, the plans are really clear and easy to follow, every timber is so precisely engineered and the design is so excellent that it was a joy to build. I have adequate DIY skills but am very much an amateur - this is probably the biggest single project I've taken on but it was the right degree of challenge to be really satisfying. Delighted with the results.",

(It is WAY more than a shed, but the name has stuck ????????\u200d\u2640\ufe0f) Installed a year ago by a fantastic team at Frost & Wade (recommended by Garden Affairs), we used it every day before lockdown (work/homework, hanging out with friends - we have three teenagers - yoga, working out, darts matches, or just escaping everyone else!). During lockdown, however, it has really come into its own and I don\u2019t think we would have survived the past few months without that extra space at the bottom of the garden. And it\u2019s not just any old space - the quality of the build is wonderful, the shed itself is beautiful and it just looks so right in our garden. It\u2019s been particularly appreciated on these hot nights, with everyone taking it in turns to sleep down there (much cooler than our house)! Garden Affairs were a dream to deal with and we recommend them to all our friends. Go on, you know you want to ????",

I wanted to install an office space at the bottom of the garden and the build quality and design looked great on the Mini Office 1 - so I purchased it.\n\nI was not disappointed. It arrived when they said it would on pallets. We decided to go for the factory painted option to save a little time. In total it took us a couple days to erect.  Almost like Lego slotting all the wooden pieces together. Once you get going it goes up fast. I recommend investing in a rubber mallet to help slot the wood together without damaging it. Also make sure you have a firm base - as the built building is heavy.\n\nThe roof took a little more time to piece together - more cutting / tools involved but not too bad.\n\nOverall really pleased with the modern design, build quality and size - just big enough for a small office without talking over the whole garden. The head height also really surprised me, very spacious - I decided to keep the inside bare wood as I love the aesthetic and smell.\n\nI would 100% recommend Garden Affairs and having a go at building it yourself!",

Now in 2020 it still looks as good as new and is doing sterling service.  We did develop a slight leak in the roof during torrential rain storms coupled with long periods of hot weather that resulted in the washer keeping the rain out dried out creating a slight leak in the roof during heavy storms.\nAlthough the summerhouse installation  was in 2014 Garden Affairs jumped into action and came to fix the problem after my contacting them.  Although the warranty had run out a couple of years ago they did not hesitate and made no charge when 2 technicians came and effected the repair. That is great after sales service from a first rate company. Who I would recommend without reservation to any one considering commissioning a garden building.  Well done Garden Affairs.",

Garden Affairs handled this brilliantly, putting in huge amounts of extra work and effort to ensure I have ended up with the building that I was hoping for.  I'd highly recommend them.",

Lovely company and very helpful friendly staff and installers who took us through the whole process from first discussion to design and installation. The new office is amazing and has transformed my work from a cramped desk in a bedroom to having a comfortable 10 x 15 foot room in the garden. Surprisingly reasonable cost too, about one quarter of the cost of the loft conversion we considered. Thanks. :-)",

It depends on you buying eye-wateringly expensive paint and painting it yourself. I can\u2019t think of any other product where the warranty is dependent on the customer paying and doing the finishing themselves. Very misleading. The brochures say the buildings can be pre-painted, which is what we asked for but we were told only the windows and doors could be pre-painted. It was only at the time of installation that we were told we had three weeks to get it painted or the \u201cwarranty\u201d would be invalid.

            "description": "Terrific company and lovely people. We spent months looking around for a log cabin as a garden studio and following a recommendation we went to Garden Affairs. Poppy and Richard took us through the various options and extended expert advice following a site visit.  Detailed costings and drawings were explained and adjusted as the requirements were modified.\nWe chose a Bertsch Holzbau cabin designed to bespoke dimensions and window arrangements, including electrical wiring and insulated floor and roof. This is a top quality construction at a very fair price.\nThe cabin was manufactured ahead of original schedule. The installation team were excellent, and finished the platform base within 2 days - not an easy task on a steepish slope with undulating ground. Construction of the\ncabin took a further 2 days and nothing seemed too much trouble for them. Richard recommended his brother Simon for the external painting, which he subsequently completed in a further couple of days. Care and precision throughout.\nHaving now fitted and connected the electrics we are absolutely delighted with our new sanctuary. Thank you so much Garden Affairs for a wonderful job and superb service!",

            "description": "We bought a 1.8m x 2.3m garden office (Mini Office) which we ordered in November 2020. It was delivered and installed in February 2021.\n\nI wanted to live with it for a while before reviewing. I must say that it's providing me an excellent work from home option that's as relevant to my new hybrid working arrangements as it was to pandemic precautions.\n\nThe visit to Wiltshire was a great purchase experience. We were expertly advised, not over-sold and our budget respected. I'm very pleased with the simple and effective design we ended up with.\n\nWe went for direct delivery and were worried about the lorry accessing somewhere near our close, which has a fair amount of parking. We need not have worried. A very nice Dutch driver brought the pallet up on his loader with no issues.\n\nTwo days later Garden Affairs assembled the office, on a slab we'd installed, in 5 hours straight. Very pleasant and efficient people, who delivered an excellent result. Well worth the money.\n\nI had a local electrician run power and data lines out to the office. I added a wall mounted heater and blinds.\n\nI think it sits in our small garden well. Just the right size for a single person to work in comfort. I've a good sized desk, proper office chair, bookcase, lighting, heating and a portable fan. There's no room for junk - which helps keep it in good order.\n\nHaving had a winter and two summers I'd say it's a great working environment. Warm enough through winter and comfortable in summer (as long at temperatures don't head north of 30C in our south facing garden). Adding inexpensive roller blinds has been essential for summer comfort. They are also a good \"anti peeking\" security feature.\n\nWorking with the door and both windows open to my garden in good weather makes for a great day.\n\nWe went for the factory paint option and the materials as.well as finish are holding up well (just need to touch up one or two very small places this year). It's clearly a quality product.\n\nOverall, I'm delighted. The office has enhanced the quality of my life. It looks great and is just the right size.\n\nMy top tips: get one! Invest in a good concrete base and professional electrical fit out. Fit blinds!",

From day one the team made everything as easy as possible and we could not be happier with the room we have now, it has more than enhanced the experience of living in our home. What has also been so impressive about Garden Affairs is that they don't leave you after the last nail has been hammered in. The aftercare has been truly exceptional and Doug and his team of builders just cannot do enough to help and advise.

The entire Garden Affairs team communicated very well throughout, although there was a slight delay to confirming the production dates, as building is manufactured in Poland.\nInstallation team, led by Doug, was fantastic and completed to a very high professional finish in just over 2 days.\nVery pleased with the finish, both interior and exterior.\nHighly recommended.",

            "description": "From start to finish, the level of help, service, and query resolution has been excellent, and we have been delighted. We ordered a Primo Office back in February this year and the no-pressure sales style was refreshing, especially in these Covid recovery times where it is often so different.\n\nThe office product is superb quality and looks amazing. And all the staff we have engaged with Anna, Ben, Sebastian, and Richard have been excellent \u2013 the crew who assembled the office in the garden were polite and hardworking and did a great job. The same applies to the electrical work sub-contractors, Zak and Josh, who were brought in to wire the office up, and Doug who came to fix the few post-build snagging issues. All were excellent and a credit to Garden Affairs \u2013 I only wish all customer service was as polite and efficient!\n\nSo, overall, we couldn\u2019t be happier! Superb product, great service and it has cut my commute down from 1.5hrs to approx. 10secs! I understand one of our neighbours has placed an order for a similar product already so the word is spreading!\n\nThank you Garden Affairs!",

            "description": "I purchased a garden room from Garden Affairs three years ago. Garden Affairs helped me get a design I liked and make a couple of bespoke modifications. They supported me through self construction. However, where I think they have excelled is in after sales service - as with anything there have been a few maintenance problems and they have been swift to assist in resolving them including patiently talking me through adjusting the doors over the phone. I couldn't ask for a better service.",

Superb service from Garden Affairs, vey helpful and knowledgable at ordering stage, and the installers were efficient, friendly and patiently went through all the details about adjusting the doors etc. My office was installed in November and the structure is very well built and insulated - I only need to run the heater on for a few hours, then set on low and it retains the heat incredibly well.\nI\u2019d highly recommend Garden Affairs.",
