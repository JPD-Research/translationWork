Licensed by the Northern Territory Government, LottoGo, which has over 1,000,000 members worldwide, can now sell official lottery tickets for worldwide jackpots to Aussies. From the best lotteries in Europe, right through to the gigantic US jackpots that soar up into the billions, you can play to win global cash prizes in just a few taps.

And by joining together with other jackpot fans in a syndicate, you’ll get to split the cost of buying multiple lottery lines, while everyone involved gets more chances to win a share of the jackpot.

The popularity of lottery syndicates has boomed in recent years on the back of some of the biggest lottery wins ever being famously won by syndicate groups, meaning winnings were shared out between colleagues, families, and friends. Now, more players want to know what it’s all about, and more importantly, how they can get involved!

Here’s all you need to know. 👇🏽


What is a lottery syndicate? 
A syndicate is a group of players who club together to buy lottery tickets, spreading the cost of buying multiple tickets while getting more chances to win! After the draw, any winnings from these tickets are shared out proportionally between members with any entries in the syndicate group. 💰


How do lottery syndicates work at LottoGo?  
Joining a lottery syndicate at LottoGo.com.au is an easy way to significantly boost your odds of winning a share of the world's top jackpot prizes – and you can get involved for just $10.00 AUD an entry.

Based on the simple logic that the more tickets purchased = the greater the chance of winning a prize, each Syndicate at LottoGo contains 10 unique lottery lines. By purchasing just 1 entry into a syndicate, you'll get a dedicated share of any winnings accumulated by all 10 of those lines in the draw.

Each syndicate is made up of 50 entries, and each entry purchased by a player is allocated an equal portion (1/50) of any winnings. So, if you’re in a syndicate that wins $100m, 1 entry in that syndicate would win $2m! And of course, if you’ve got multiple entries in a single syndicate group, then you’ll get multiple shares in the winnings.

Syndicates are all about community spirit, with players getting together to go for a share in mega jackpots! Check out all Syndicates available at LottoGo here!


What syndicates can I join at LottoGo? 
LottoGo.com.au offers customers in Australia the opportunity to play a choice of 4 of the world’s most legendary lotteries with a syndicate. As you’ll be able to tell from the quick stats below, you don’t see jackpots bigger than these…
US Powerball: This uncapped American lottery holds the record for the world’s biggest jackpot ever! The whopping $1.586 billion USD (approximately $2.279 billion AUD!) won in January 2016 was split between 3 lucky players with winning tickets from California, Florida, and Tennessee.
US Mega Millions: Up there with US Powerball, US Mega Millions holds the record for the world’s second-biggest jackpot ever won! $1.537 billion USD (approximately $2.173 billion AUD!) was scooped by a single player from South Carolina.
As another lottery with uncapped rollovers, you can expect plenty more US Mega Millions jackpots vying for the world record.
EuroMillions: With an opening jackpot of €17 million, EuroMillions is Europe’s wealthiest lottery with the potential to reach up to €250 million! One UK player scooped a mammoth £170.22 million in October 2019 (approximately $310,653,325 million AUD!) - the richest EuroMillions jackpot to date.
UK Lotto: The UK’s favourite lottery has given away over £78 billion in prizes and created more almost 6,000 millionaires (or multi-millionaires!) since launching in 1994. UK Lotto’s jackpots can rollover up to 5 times - starting from at least £2 million on a Wednesday, and at least £3.8 million on a Saturday.
Just imagine what you could do with a share in a jackpot this size… it’s time to start dreaming! 😎


The world’s biggest lottery syndicate winners!  
We told you syndicates were making waves in the lottery world, so here’s just a few of the syndicate success stories that hit the headlines:
US Mega Millions: A 4-player syndicate won a jackpot over a BILLION (USD)!
This $1.05 BILLION Mega Millions jackpot was won in January 2021 by a 4-member syndicate in Michigan. This made history as the 3rd biggest jackpot prize in the world, as well as the 2nd richest Mega Millions jackpot, ever. In choosing to take a lump-sum payment, these 4 players shared $766m equally between them!
US Mega Millions: ‘The 3 Amigos’ won a share of the record-breaking $656 MILLION jackpot (USD)!
In March 2012, 3 tickets hit the $656m US Mega Millions jackpot – winning £218.6m each! One of those winning tickets belonged to ‘The 3 Amigos’ syndicate - 3 colleagues who clubbed together with $20 each to buy 60 lottery lines. After taking the lump-sum pay-out option, these amigos walked away with a whopping $35m richer each, and that’s even after taxes!
US Mega Millions: 11 colleagues shared a $543 MILLION (USD) lottery win!
The largest Mega Millions syndicate win to date was created by a spur-of-the-moment office syndicate in 2018! $543m was split evenly between 11 colleagues working in financial services in Santa Clara, California. Despite taking home $29m million each after tax, these winners decided to stay in their jobs and use the winnings to pay off mortgages and travel! ✈
EuroMillions - €175.4 MILLION of Irish luck for a Dublin family syndicate!
In February 2019, 9 family members clubbed together as a syndicate for EuroMillions and bagged the highest lottery jackpot ever won in Ireland! As they were the only jackpot-winning ticket in the draw, they got to split the entire €175.4m jackpot between them and planned to share their mega winnings with all their other friends and family – there’s definitely plenty to go around!
US Powerball: ‘The Tennessee Twenty’ split $420 MILLION jackpot (USD)!
Dubbed ‘The ‘Tennessee Twenty’, 20 colleagues working at a manufacturing plant in Portland, Tennessee, hit the $420m jackpot on US Powerball with their syndicate ticket in 2016! The cash value of the prize was worth $254m, working out at around $12.7m each before taxes!

[LongFormTCsMMPBSYNDAUS]Instantly boost your chances to win a prize on the world’s biggest lotteries by getting involved in a LottoGo.com.au syndicate!
Licensed by the Northern Territory Government, LottoGo, which has over 1,000,000 members worldwide, can now sell official lottery tickets for worldwide jackpots to Aussies. From the best lotteries in Europe, right through to the gigantic US jackpots that soar up into the billions, you can play to win global cash prizes in just a few taps.

And by joining together with other jackpot fans in a syndicate, you’ll get to split the cost of buying multiple lottery lines, while everyone involved gets more chances to win a share of the jackpot.

The popularity of lottery syndicates has boomed in recent years on the back of some of the biggest lottery wins ever being famously won by syndicate groups, meaning winnings were shared out between colleagues, families, and friends. Now, more players want to know what it’s all about, and more importantly, how they can get involved!

Here’s all you need to know. 👇🏽


What is a lottery syndicate? 
A syndicate is a group of players who club together to buy lottery tickets, spreading the cost of buying multiple tickets while getting more chances to win! After the draw, any winnings from these tickets are shared out proportionally between members with any entries in the syndicate group. 💰


How do lottery syndicates work at LottoGo?  
Joining a lottery syndicate at LottoGo.com.au is an easy way to significantly boost your odds of winning a share of the world's top jackpot prizes – and you can get involved for just $10.00 AUD an entry.

Based on the simple logic that the more tickets purchased = the greater the chance of winning a prize, each Syndicate at LottoGo contains 10 unique lottery lines. By purchasing just 1 entry into a syndicate, you'll get a dedicated share of any winnings accumulated by all 10 of those lines in the draw.

Each syndicate is made up of 50 entries, and each entry purchased by a player is allocated an equal portion (1/50) of any winnings. So, if you’re in a syndicate that wins $100m, 1 entry in that syndicate would win $2m! And of course, if you’ve got multiple entries in a single syndicate group, then you’ll get multiple shares in the winnings.

Syndicates are all about community spirit, with players getting together to go for a share in mega jackpots! Check out all Syndicates available at LottoGo here!

How do lottery syndicates work at LottoGo?  
Joining a lottery syndicate at LottoGo.com.au is an easy way to significantly boost your odds of winning a share of the world's top jackpot prizes – and you can get involved for just $10.00 AUD an entry.

Based on the simple logic that the more tickets purchased = the greater the chance of winning a prize, each Syndicate at LottoGo contains 10 unique lottery lines. By purchasing just 1 entry into a syndicate, you'll get a dedicated share of any winnings accumulated by all 10 of those lines in the draw.

Each syndicate is made up of 50 entries, and each entry purchased by a player is allocated an equal portion (1/50) of any winnings. So, if you’re in a syndicate that wins $100m, 1 entry in that syndicate would win $2m! And of course, if you’ve got multiple entries in a single syndicate group, then you’ll get multiple shares in the winnings.

Syndicates are all about community spirit, with players getting together to go for a share in mega jackpots! Check out all Syndicates available at LottoGo here!


What syndicates can I join at LottoGo? 
LottoGo.com.au offers customers in Australia the opportunity to play a choice of 4 of the world’s most legendary lotteries with a syndicate. As you’ll be able to tell from the quick stats below, you don’t see jackpots bigger than these…
US Powerball: This uncapped American lottery holds the record for the world’s biggest jackpot ever! The whopping $1.586 billion USD (approximately $2.279 billion AUD!) won in January 2016 was split between 3 lucky players with winning tickets from California, Florida, and Tennessee.
US Mega Millions: Up there with US Powerball, US Mega Millions holds the record for the world’s second-biggest jackpot ever won! $1.537 billion USD (approximately $2.173 billion AUD!) was scooped by a single player from South Carolina.
As another lottery with uncapped rollovers, you can expect plenty more US Mega Millions jackpots vying for the world record.
EuroMillions: With an opening jackpot of €17 million, EuroMillions is Europe’s wealthiest lottery with the potential to reach up to €250 million! One UK player scooped a mammoth £170.22 million in October 2019 (approximately $310,653,325 million AUD!) - the richest EuroMillions jackpot to date.
UK Lotto: The UK’s favourite lottery has given away over £78 billion in prizes and created more almost 6,000 millionaires (or multi-millionaires!) since launching in 1994. UK Lotto’s jackpots can rollover up to 5 times - starting from at least £2 million on a Wednesday, and at least £3.8 million on a Saturday.

US Mega Millions: ‘The 3 Amigos’ won a share of the record-breaking $656 MILLION jackpot (USD)!

For example, if you purchased 2 syndicate entries for US Mega Millions and each was automatically allocated to a different syndicate group, you'd be playing for a 1/50th share in any winnings from each group. However, if your 2 entries were allocated to the same syndicate group, you'd be playing for a 2/50th share in any winnings from that one group.

[LongFormTCsMMPBSYNDAUS]Instantly boost your chances to win a prize on the world’s biggest lotteries by getting involved in a LottoGo.com.au syndicate!
Licensed by the Northern Territory Government, LottoGo, which has over 1,000,000 members worldwide, can now sell official lottery tickets for worldwide jackpots to Aussies. From the best lotteries in Europe, right through to the gigantic US jackpots that soar up into the billions, you can play to win global cash prizes in just a few taps.

And by joining together with other jackpot fans in a syndicate, you’ll get to split the cost of buying multiple lottery lines, while everyone involved gets more chances to win a share of the jackpot.

The popularity of lottery syndicates has boomed in recent years on the back of some of the biggest lottery wins ever being famously won by syndicate groups, meaning winnings were shared out between colleagues, families, and friends. Now, more players want to know what it’s all about, and more importantly, how they can get involved!

Here’s all you need to know. 👇🏽


What is a lottery syndicate? 
A syndicate is a group of players who club together to buy lottery tickets, spreading the cost of buying multiple tickets while getting more chances to win! After the draw, any winnings from these tickets are shared out proportionally between members with any entries in the syndicate group. 💰


How do lottery syndicates work at LottoGo?  
Joining a lottery syndicate at LottoGo.com.au is an easy way to significantly boost your odds of winning a share of the world's top jackpot prizes – and you can get involved for just $10.00 AUD an entry.

Based on the simple logic that the more tickets purchased = the greater the chance of winning a prize, each Syndicate at LottoGo contains 10 unique lottery lines. By purchasing just 1 entry into a syndicate, you'll get a dedicated share of any winnings accumulated by all 10 of those lines in the draw.

Each syndicate is made up of 50 entries, and each entry purchased by a player is allocated an equal portion (1/50) of any winnings. So, if you’re in a syndicate that wins $100m, 1 entry in that syndicate would win $2m! And of course, if you’ve got multiple entries in a single syndicate group, then you’ll get multiple shares in the winnings.

Syndicates are all about community spirit, with players getting together to go for a share in mega jackpots! Check out all Syndicates available at LottoGo here!


What syndicates can I join at LottoGo? 
LottoGo.com.au offers customers in Australia the opportunity to play a choice of 4 of the world’s most legendary lotteries with a syndicate. As you’ll be able to tell from the quick stats below, you don’t see jackpots bigger than these…
US Powerball: This uncapped American lottery holds the record for the world’s biggest jackpot ever! The whopping $1.586 billion USD (approximately $2.279 billion AUD!) won in January 2016 was split between 3 lucky players with winning tickets from California, Florida, and Tennessee.
US Mega Millions: Up there with US Powerball, US Mega Millions holds the record for the world’s second-biggest jackpot ever won! $1.537 billion USD (approximately $2.173 billion AUD!) was scooped by a single player from South Carolina.
As another lottery with uncapped rollovers, you can expect plenty more US Mega Millions jackpots vying for the world record.
EuroMillions: With an opening jackpot of €17 million, EuroMillions is Europe’s wealthiest lottery with the potential to reach up to €250 million! One UK player scooped a mammoth £170.22 million in October 2019 (approximately $310,653,325 million AUD!) - the richest EuroMillions jackpot to date.
UK Lotto: The UK’s favourite lottery has given away over £78 billion in prizes and created more almost 6,000 millionaires (or multi-millionaires!) since launching in 1994. UK Lotto’s jackpots can rollover up to 5 times - starting from at least £2 million on a Wednesday, and at least £3.8 million on a Saturday.
Just imagine what you could do with a share in a jackpot this size… it’s time to start dreaming! 😎


The world’s biggest lottery syndicate winners!  
We told you syndicates were making waves in the lottery world, so here’s just a few of the syndicate success stories that hit the headlines:
US Mega Millions: A 4-player syndicate won a jackpot over a BILLION (USD)!
This $1.05 BILLION Mega Millions jackpot was won in January 2021 by a 4-member syndicate in Michigan. This made history as the 3rd biggest jackpot prize in the world, as well as the 2nd richest Mega Millions jackpot, ever. In choosing to take a lump-sum payment, these 4 players shared $766m equally between them!
US Mega Millions: ‘The 3 Amigos’ won a share of the record-breaking $656 MILLION jackpot (USD)!
In March 2012, 3 tickets hit the $656m US Mega Millions jackpot – winning £218.6m each! One of those winning tickets belonged to ‘The 3 Amigos’ syndicate - 3 colleagues who clubbed together with $20 each to buy 60 lottery lines. After taking the lump-sum pay-out option, these amigos walked away with a whopping $35m richer each, and that’s even after taxes!
US Mega Millions: 11 colleagues shared a $543 MILLION (USD) lottery win!
The largest Mega Millions syndicate win to date was created by a spur-of-the-moment office syndicate in 2018! $543m was split evenly between 11 colleagues working in financial services in Santa Clara, California. Despite taking home $29m million each after tax, these winners decided to stay in their jobs and use the winnings to pay off mortgages and travel! ✈
EuroMillions - €175.4 MILLION of Irish luck for a Dublin family syndicate!
In February 2019, 9 family members clubbed together as a syndicate for EuroMillions and bagged the highest lottery jackpot ever won in Ireland! As they were the only jackpot-winning ticket in the draw, they got to split the entire €175.4m jackpot between them and planned to share their mega winnings with all their other friends and family – there’s definitely plenty to go around!
US Powerball: ‘The Tennessee Twenty’ split $420 MILLION jackpot (USD)!
Dubbed ‘The ‘Tennessee Twenty’, 20 colleagues working at a manufacturing plant in Portland, Tennessee, hit the $420m jackpot on US Powerball with their syndicate ticket in 2016! The cash value of the prize was worth $254m, working out at around $12.7m each before taxes!
